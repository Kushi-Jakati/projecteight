In the 2012 film Life of Pi, the sole survivor of a shipwreck recalls his experience of surviving in the sea with the companionship of a tiger. Through the five film form elements of technical aspects, mise-en-scene, narrative, history/society, and genre, Life of Pi creates a vivid and notable sense of realism interwoven with fantastical elements that reaffirm faith and religion. 
Life of Pi’s technical aspects set the scene for the audience to become immersed in the experiences of Pi Patel, the main character of the film. The first primary film technique is the movement of the camera along the characters’ or objects’ actions in order to convey certain moods. The viewers first see this at the beginning of the film, where Pi Patel talks about the origin of his name. The camera slowly tracks his uncle under the water as he swims across the Piscine Molitor (evoking a sense of surreality). This camera movement is later heavily used when Pi is stranded at sea in order to create a sense of chaos. For example, when Pi realizes he is stuck with carnivorous animals such as the hyena and tiger, he hangs on the pole extending outwards from the boat in hopes of avoiding them. The camera movement follows the rockiness of the boat, which helps depict Pi’s dizziness and dishevelment as he is confronted with an unexpected situation. Conversely, viewers see this type of rocky camera movement lessen as Pi comes to terms with the tiger and becomes more experienced in dealing with both the sea and the tiger, thus evoking a greater sense of security. 
The second primary film technique is the film’s deliberate variation of point-of-view (POV) shots and far-away cuts during intense moments. This technique is first used when Pi realizes the boat is sinking. As he witnesses the front of the boat being overwhelmed with water, the camera zooms out to capture his back and the massive incoming wave, illuminating the severity of the situation. The camera then switches to a POV shot, which captures the front of the boat bearing the brunt of the wave, with sailors being washed off the boat. This POV shot helps visualize Pi’s powerlessness in the face of a tragedy, which becomes further emphasized when Pi fails to find his family on the ship. Another example of this switch is when Pi confronts the tiger on the rescue boat with his own makeshift spear in order to get some fish. The camera first uses a slightly closer back shot, which shows that Pi is facing a much more powerful force, and then switches to a POV shot in which the spear is jabbing at the tiger’s mouth. However, while the POV shot in the previous example demonstrated Pi’s helplessness as he watched lives being lost from a distance, the POV shot in this example now shows Pi taking control of his situation for the sake of his life. It should also be noted that there are constant cuts between Pi and the opposing object/animal in both of these examples, which help further evoke a sense of tension in viewers.  
Lastly, a notable film technique, despite not being used as frequently, includes dissolves. Dissolves are often used in this film to signify the passing of time or the switch between time periods. Examples are seen when Pi begins recounting his story (the scene dissolves into his childhood) and also when he is spending time building his makeshift survival tools in the ocean and writing in his journal. Another example is when Pi collapses on shore after tugging the boat onto an island. The dissolves that occur before Pi wakes up show that Pi has been out of consciousness for quite some time. Dissolves are particularly important in Life of Pi as they both bridge the gap between Pi’s transformations and signify a change in a character’s appearance or behavior during survival.  

Meanwhile, the mise-en-scene of the film either serves to reaffirm the realism created by the film techniques or add a layer of mysticality to it. The first example of this is Pi and the tiger’s appearance on the boat. As time progresses, Pi becomes thinner and more disheveled (with a sinking ribcage, a face covered with dirt, and matted hair late in the film), a stark contrast to his healthy body at the beginning of the film. The tiger also does not fare better, with a matching sunken ribcage. Pi’s clothes change as well, with his clothing taking on a more primal appearance (shirtless and clad in only pants) with time. As a result, these gradual yet insignificant details help reflect Pi's journey, from an ordinary man to a man desperate for survival—despite appearing weak, Pi's established sense of toughness in a hostile sea should not be underestimated.
The repeated contrasts of lighting and setting also play a big role in mise-en-scene; Life of Pi purposefully switches between mundane/survival scenes and mystical scenes in order to create a fantastical type of realism. The first example of this switch is seen at the very beginning of Pi being stranded in the sea. As he finally realizes he’s the only one left of the shipwreck during the night, the scene fades into black and cuts to a scene with the sun peeking out. In this scene, there are clear waters reflecting the blue sky and golden-tinted clouds as Pi starts writing a rescue request note. This magical setting, in contrast to the dark night Pi was previously enshrouded in, helps symbolize the persevering hope Pi has despite everything being taken away from him. The second example of this switch is when Pi is in the midst of adjusting to life on the sea with the tiger (note that these scenes are set in the day) and is agonizing over the loss of his morale—such as killing a fish for the sake of food despite being a vegetarian. During the night, Pi is awestruck as he witnesses a sea of jellyfish and bioluminescence; once again, this magical scene washes away some of his worries and gives him a reason to keep looking forward.  

Lastly, the third example of this switch is when Pi’s boat is swept away by a huge thunderstorm. The scene seems to be on a dark gray-blue scale and is filled with harsh waves and lightning. Pi, at first believing it to be a sign of God, soon gets upset and screams at the sky, frustrated that he's given everything to God yet God isn’t being "compassionate and merciful" to him or the tiger. After the thunderstorm ends, the scene then shifts to a calmer and more mundane setting in the sea. Pi realizes both he and the tiger don’t have the resources to live longer. In despair, he realizes they’re "dying" as he lays the tiger’s head on his lap. The scene fades back to black, only to reveal Pi waking up to find the boat docked on an island. Although the island supplies Pi and the tiger with the resources to live, Pi realizes that the island will eventually kill them as he discovers the island changes in the night: although lit with beautiful green lights, the crystal blue water that was previously drinkable in the day turns luminescent green and acidic in the night. When Pi finds a human tooth in a flower, he takes it as a sign to leave the island. These three scenes relate to Pi’s belief in religion. The almost otherworldly thunderstorm scene demonstrates Pi’s doubt and frustration toward God, who was supposed to be benevolent. When Pi lays the tiger’s head on his lap, his actions symbolize a loss of hope. Finally, the third scene, in which the thunderstorm actually guided Pi to an island, went beyond science and allowed Pi to prolong his survival (despite not being able to stay there for long) and revitalize his belief in God. Overall, it is these magical moments that give a literal and figurative meaning to "light following after the dark" and explain why Pi remains religious despite all his experiences of doubt and despair during his survival. 

One last special mise en scène that should be duly highlighted is when Pi and the tiger finally learn to coexist and are resting peacefully during the night. The tiger, previously gazing off into the night sky, suddenly tilts his head to look at the ocean. The camera then focuses on the tiger’s face, zooming in until the scene fades into scenes of a fantasy-like ocean, Pi’s mother, and the sunken ship. Pi also stares at the ocean reflecting the sparkling night sky (which coincidentally looks like the universe). This scene is a reference to when Pi’s mother introduces him to the story of Yashoda and Krishna, in which Yashoda glances at the inside of Krishna’s mouth and sees the universe. Although viewers are uncertain about what exactly Pi realizes at that moment, it can be inferred that Pi is having a moment of self-retrospection similar to Yashoda, witnessing something greater than himself (perhaps God).  
In terms of narrative, Life of Pi follows a restricted one. As Pi recounts his journey to the author, the viewers are only as knowledgeable as the author; in other words, they are subject to the information given by Pi gradually throughout the movie. Although they know for certain that Pi has survived his journey, they are unaware of every other detail (such as whether the tiger lives or dies). This restricted narrative immerses the viewers in the story, as any conjectures drawn during Pi’s recounting cannot be verified unless it is by Pi himself. 
For example, as Pi tells his story, more fantastical aspects (excluding being on board with a tiger) pop up, such as the luminescent sea and carnivorous island. It certainly isn’t impossible, but the investigators in Pi’s case are skeptical. As a result, Pi comes up with another (and more grotesque) story—a story in which he became delusional and imagined being stranded with a tiger and other zoo animals in order to keep his sanity and deal with his trauma of eating other human flesh. This more grotesque narrative logically makes sense; additionally, the restricted narrative prevents the viewers from verifying Pi’s story with other sources and causes more doubt. Thus, viewers are left with the choice to either believe in fantastical, hopeful elements or a scientific, brutal perspective. In other words, viewers must face the decision to believe in faith or science—in one person (whether it be Pi or God) or in society’s instilled knowledge. It should also be noted that Pi and the two men who interviewed him after his rescue represent two different aspects of society. Pi is a character that demonstrates religion can be used as a guiding force as long as one believes in the signs given to them; meanwhile, the two men that interview him (and other people Pi interacts with, such as his father) symbolize society’s steadfast belief in science over everything else. 
Ultimately, the author interviewing Pi Patel chooses to believe in faith, which becomes symbolic of the message Life of Pi is attempting to convey: society is so immersed in what it knows, it neglects what it could discover. That is the purpose of faith and religion: although science has taken humanity farther than religion ever has (as Pi’s father notes), religion provides an irreplaceable hope and mental direction for humanity. With the addition of the technical aspects that solidify a certain sense of realism in a generally fantasy-like story and the mise-en-scene that creates a sense of determination in a depressive setting, more credibility is added to Pi’s story—rather than the grotesque one that seems more logical.
Subsequently, in the terms of history and society, Life of Pi portrays society as too fearful or dismissive of the unknown. Examples are seen at the beginning of the film when Pi tries to feed the tiger ("Richard Parker") with his bare hands. His father becomes furious and claims that animals are not like humans—they cannot coexist. Pi is only seeing "(his) emotions reflected back at (him)" in the tiger’s eyes. However, as seen throughout the film, the tiger becomes Pi’s strength. It keeps him "alert," and eventually, the tiger stops seeing him as a threat and begins viewing him (reluctantly) as an acquaintance.
