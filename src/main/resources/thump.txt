Yellow Wallpapers




2010


"Pick a wallpaper, Seva." His Ma smiled at him. Honey colored eyes bent into a crescent gazed down at him. Seva looked at the face that was a stark difference from his own. A face of rich chocolate skin, with berry lips and straight white teeth.


He often wondered why he couldn’t look like his Ma. However, his Ma thought the opposite. I’m so glad you got your dad’s color and not mine, she would say. Why his Ma thought that way, he didn’t know. But it was probably the same reason she never let him go out in the sun. 


Seva scrutinized the wallpapers on the selection sheet in front of him: pastel flowers; red dinosaurs; leaping unicorns; zooming race cars. He opened his mouth, about to point to the race cars when his eyes landed on a wallpaper in the very corner, garish yellow in color. It had a few red poppies in each corner of the wallpaper. His eyes darted back and forth between the two. He, who had been previously so firm on the race cars that looked like his HotWheel collection, hesitated. The yellow reminded him of his Ma’s eyes. 


"I want that one." He pointed to the corner. 


"Pfttttttt." His Ma laughed out loud. 


"This one? Are you sure?" 


"Why can’t I?" Seva’s brows furrowed, lips pursued in a pout. 


"Nothing—whatever my betta wants. You’re turning ten today. I just didn’t know you had the soul of an Ajji already." 


Seva turned his head away from those words, facing the opposite side of Home Depot’s aisle. He couldn’t understand why his Ma was laughing at him. It was a hard decision, yet his Ma was laughing so happily. 


"Ok, ok. I’ll stop teasing." His Ma covered her smile with her hand. 


"I’ll take this one, please." His Ma told the worker standing to the side. As the worker packed up the wallpaper, she turned back to face Seva.


"Let’s go back home?" She reached out her hand to him.


Seva glanced to the side with his arms crossed. Eyebrows still furrowed, he squinted, attempting to shoot his meanest glare. He looked down at his Ma’s hands, which held the wrinkles that indicated her age. He placed his cold, chubby hands into her warm, calloused one.


"Ok." He whispered.

"Seva, could you cut the vegetables for me? I’m making spinach curry today."


"Yeah, just gimme a second," Seva yelled back as he closed the mahogany door and dropped his backpack to its left. He bent down and grabbed the back of his shoes, peeling them off. Walking down the short and narrow hallway decorated with wooden frames holding warm colored paintings of trees and leaves, he averted his eyes from the contrasting out of place yellow wallpaper. At this point, his mother was keeping that wallpaper just to spite him. 


"Ma, are you ever going to change that wallpaper?" Seva complained as he took a left from the end of the hallway. Entering the kitchen, he inhaled the smell of masala and chicken. 


"Why? You’re the one who picked it out anyway." She retorted. Her thick and black hair tied in a bun was already falling apart as she paced from one end of the kitchen to another with spinach stalks in hand. 


"Yeah, but it’s everywhere. Why would you make the main hall’s wallpaper what I chose when I was ten."  


"Well, why not?" 


Seva laughed. He rolled up his sleeves and walked to the sink. As he washed his hands, his gaze turned toward the kitchen, a marble expanse with a countertop in the middle, a sink to the left, a stove to the right, and a round mahogany dining table with lit candles on top at the end. It was things like that that made him joke about the hallway wallpapers. Their house, although small and rural, was not one that adorned tacky decorations. 


They may have had only four rooms in which their doors were located at each end corner of the hallway, but the rooms were decorated by his Ma. And his Ma loved to have the feeling of royalty. Velvet curtains of dark ocean blue were draped next to each window. Tables, doors, and chairs were crafted of the finest mahogany. The couches were of dark leather. Queen mattresses lay within the two bedrooms, with silky red comforters to battle the heat of Arizona. A faint citrus scent lingered in every room (at least, that was what his friends had told him—he had never smelled it himself). 


  Ma told him it was the smaller spaces that were closer to nature that gave the rich feeling of home. So she made her house resemble exactly that.


It thus became a running gag for the family of two to mention that garish yellow wallpaper of the main hall. One would complain. The other would ignore the complaint. But they never did anything about the wallpaper. Ma thought it was his tenth birthday memento. He remembered the reason he picked it. And that was all it needed to stay for the past seven years.


"What did you do today?" His Ma asked.


"Me? I just hung out with friends. Grace was complaining about her girlfrien one of her girl friends." Seva froze before correcting his words.


"Girlfriend? Grace, the girl who came over a few months back and brought flowers? She has a girlfriend?" His Ma was always perceptive, never falling for his cover ups.


"Yeah, she’s dating a girl who’s kind of off and on. It’s weird." Seva bit the bullet, continuing the topic like it was a normal occurrence. Which it should’ve been, except it was his Ma he was talking to.


 "Dating…a girl? Teens these days are so crazy. Going down the hard path when they don’t even know what they’re doing.." His Ma frowned and muttered as she stirred the curry in the steel pot over the stove.


Seva paused his actions with the knife. He could only see his Ma’s back, but he could tell her tone was already worsening. 


"I mean, it’s her choice. She’s free to like whoever she likes." Seva tried reasoning. 


"The hardships...The discrimination they’ll receive later down the line. Is it really worth it?" 


Seva kept quiet. Silence permeated the kitchen for a few minutes. Each time this conversation happened, he always asked the same question. 


"Ma, is it the hardship or do you just dislike gay people?" 


"This again? Why would I dislike them? They just live hard lives. It’s tough on the parents as well seeing all that."


It was a mystery what overcame Seva at that moment. It might’ve been the previously pleasant atmosphere that made Seva comfortable. Or it might’ve been the result of a fruitless conversation that happened far too many times. But Seva took a deep breath, and smiled while asking, "Well, what if I was gay?" 


He had never seen his Ma turn so fast before, her tightened lips fully displaying the consternation on her face. 


"You’re what now?" 


Feeling his smile slightly drop, Seva looked down and focused back on the second onion still yet to be cut. He grabbed it, chopped off the ends, and started peeling its red outer shell.


"I’m joking, don’t worry." Seva laughed and looked back up again with a teasing expression.


"Why? You thought I was serious?"


His Ma put a hand over her chest and rubbed it. "Don’t scare me like that, Seva. My chest started paining again. Everyone can do that stuff, but not my child." 


"Ok, got it. Don’t worry." Seva’s eyes were burning. 


"Man, this onion is strong." He muttered.

"Seva, what is this?" His Ma stood in the middle of the hallway, holding his phone up. She was rocking side to side on her feet in the hallway, her thumb caught between her teeth. Seva had just gotten back home from school. Slowly closing the door behind him and dropping his bag to the ground, he looked at the vague string of text messages on display and cursed inwardly. Shit, he shouldn’t have left his phone at home. Whatever was on there, it couldn’t be good. 


"What’s what?" He asked while attempting to feign his best curious expression. He even arched his neck toward the phone a bit and squinted his eyes, as if the subject in question wasn’t him.


"This." His Ma walked forward and shoved the screen in front of him. 


Seva looked down at the phone screen, where the last text was sent was one from his friend. 


Mary: are we on tonight? We’re going to finally get you a boyfriend today, mark my words."


He bit his lips. Damn it, Mary. 


Seva snatched the phone away from her, red climbing up his pale cheeks and neck. 


"Why did you go through my phone??" 


"I was cleaning your room and saw the notification pop up. It wasn’t on purpose. Now tell me, what do those texts mean?"  


Thousands of thoughts whirred through Seva’s head. He averted his eyes from Ma’s, focusing his line of sight beside her, where the yellow wallpaper stood in all its glory, contrasting with the wooden frame holding the serene painting of gentle ocean waves. He always sucked at lying in front of her. 


"It’s a running joke. We do that a lot." 


"Do you think I’m stupid? I saw the rest of the texts Seva. She keeps mentioning boys and you go along with it." His Ma grabbed the lapels of his shirt with both hands, her usually mellow honey eyes swimming with disbelief. 


"Is what those texts say true? Do you like boys?" Her voice was getting louder, almost reaching the volume of a shout. 


Seva winced and grabbed her hands, prying her fingertips gently off her shirt. He lowered her arms back to her side. 


However, his voice matched the volume of his Ma’s. "Why are you asking a question you already know the answer to?"


His Ma’s eyes widened at that moment. A sharp gasp left her lips as she stumbled a few steps back from him. 


"No, no, no. What would my friends think if this gets out? What would my company think? I’ll be ruined." She grabbed her hair. 


Anger began building up inside Seva. Although he didn’t expect a warm, comforting hug, he didn’t expect his Ma to think of his sexuality as something to be damaging. 


"Can’t you just accept me? Is that so hard for you?" He yelled. 


"Real life doesn’t work that way, Seva! You’ll be screwed! And I’ll go down with you because I won’t be able to abandon you when you’re suffering!" She screamed back. 


Seva scoffed in disbelief. He pointed at himself. "That’s what you call your love? Seriously?" 


"Look at me! Is this not what you call love? I work day and night for you!" Tears were streaming down his Ma’s face, wetting her cheeks and dripping off her chin. She rubbed her chest, her breaths coming out in staggers. 


Seva clenched his hands and glared at his Ma. His eyes fell on the hand on her chest and looked back up to the petite figure of his Ma, her messy black hair, her dark purple under eye bags that were so often covered up with concealer every time she went to work. 


He gritted his teeth. 


There was a certain sense of traditionalism embedded in his Ma’a thinking. It was one of the reasons he had chosen to never come out to his Ma. 


Because Seva’s mom was his everything. She raised him when his father wouldn’t. Lifted him up on her shoulders and threw him up in the air when he came home as a child. Cooked him all types of food after her long days of work. 


It was because he knew that he stalled this day as much as possible. He could never let one thing hurt her, not even what made him him, with her heart pains that came with the built up stress and the work and her social life that was the only thing she had beside him. She wouldn’t be able to handle the inevitable gossiping that came with the aunties. She would make her social life and him a choice, and choose him in the end. 


Seva glanced once again at the yellow wallpapers. He laughed at himself. They were especially an eye sore today. 


"What do you want me to do?"


His Ma looked up at him, light slowly emerging from her honey eyes. 


Her eyes tentative, forehead creased and lips pursued, she whispered, "Keep it a secret. I’m not asking you to deny it but stop making it public to your friends. If word gets around, how " 


Seva cut her off. "I got it. I’ll stop telling people. Happy?"
 
He saw his Ma’s furrowed eyebrows loosen. She rushed toward him and hugged him, squeezing him tight. Seva let her hold him, feeling her warm embrace even as he felt the ice in his veins.  


"Thank you, Seva. Thank you so much." She sobbed. She grabbed his face with her hands and began raining his cheek with kisses as if the weight on her heart was the lightest it had ever been since she got the notification. 


"Mm." He hummed, vapid eyes trained on the yellow wallpapers. His chest felt heavier with each kiss that seemed to be nailing his decision against his heart. It was a decision that stripped away his identity, yet his Ma was laughing so happily. 


His Ma pulled away from him and looked him in the eyes. She laughed as she wiped her tears away with her hand.


"What dinner do you want me to make you? I’ll make you your favorite bajji, hm?"


"Ok." He whispered.
