It was nighttime. In the corner of the rowdy city of Nasta lies an inconspicuous and quiet neighborhood located at the very edge of the city walls: Asprsya. Asprsya consisted of only one street. That street was small but compact, with dilapidated houses mashed together without care and small piles of trash decorating the concrete roads littered with cracks. At the end of the street was an alleyway situated in between two old, red brick buildings, holding the only official dumpster in Asprysa and a dead end. The smell of moldy bread, fermented grapes, and rotten meat creeped out of the darkness. It was quite a deterrent to any approaching resident.
Except one. A thin, scrawny boy was lurking near the alleyway, his dark eyebrows furrowed in contemplation as he pursued his cracked lips. He shifted his feet, constantly taking one step forward and one step back. His eyes reflected the stale piece of bread lying near the dumpster.
Finally, the boy seemed to have made a decision. Brandishing his plastic fork, he took one bold step toward the bread before freezing. A pair of luminescent emerald eyes stared quietly from the darkness. Out from the alleyway stepped a black rat the size of a basketball, its black fur matted with a dark-reddish gooey substance. It hissed fiercely at the boy, baring its sharp teeth. 
The boy let out a scream and chucked the fork at the rat. He turned back and ran away with all his might. His moment of panic had even caused him to almost trip on his black flip-flops. 
The rat dodged the plastic fork with practiced ease. It stared at the boy's retreating back with indifferent eyes. Humans, Ratri thought. The only species that would scream in terror at a smaller species and pathetically try to defend themselves.
Perhaps for that reason, his current predicament was even more embarrassing: running back and forth, dodging pest control, and getting hit by sharp weapons thrown at him.
As strong as he was, avoiding a hail of objects as he was cornered was nearly impossible with the restrictions the Empress had set for him. The human hatred for this rodent species defied his predictions. But it was certainly within the Empress's realm. 
5 Days Ago. The capital of the Nirdaya Empire. 
"Live with the human race for one month as a rat. Any use of force is prohibited." She had said. Her talon fingers tapped gently on the white throne's diamond armrest as she looked at the man kneeling down below. 
Ratri looked up, his emerald eyes, the only facial feature shown from his black mask, displaying a hint of puzzlement and reluctance. 
"It would be best if my punishment was to stay within the capital of the empire. I can be on house arrest and still protect the Empire." He responded. He glanced pointedly at a maid preparing sweets near the Empress. 
"Even the weakest of our race will be enough to monitor primitive people."
The Empress arched her eyebrow at Ratri's implied words. His arrogance in the face of the throne was worthy of being the commander of the empire's military force, but also insolent. 
"I am not asking, Ratri. A severe demotion or this mild punishment for your actions. The people will not let you stay in the capital until they see you repent." The Empress smiled, ice frosting the arc of her lips. The black tusks from her upper lips followed.
Ratri's mouth slid into a grimace as he felt her words strike his body with electrifying currents. He lowered his head in submission. Once the Empress commanded, the Nirdayas were bound to her will. Silence permeated the white, boundless room for a minute until the Empress finally opened her purple lips with a sigh. 
"As your childhood friend, I have seen you fight each war with striking calmness and rationality. You have repeatedly brought victory to the Empire. Yet our people only grow to fear you. Why do you think I'm giving you this specific punishment?"  
The rat stood outside the alleyway, his thin tail swishing in contemplation. Despite the public outcry, he knew sacrificing one of the Empire's cities to siege the main fortress of the enemy nation was the most efficient method to end the year-long war. Their whines of millions being sacrificed were akin to a fly buzzing in his ear. After all, he had saved billions. 
Alternate methods? Ratri let out a short hiss at the thought of it. Alternate methods did exist; the public was not wrong. But prolonging a war and losing a possible victory to save a mere city was foolish. Ratri retreated back into the alleyway's darkness. There was no use thinking about his answer to the Empress's question when he would be back in his designated position in a month. He lay on his side, carefully avoiding the open and still bleeding gashes, and closed his eyes. He'd rest for a month in this deserted alleyway before returning.
Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle. Ratri awoke to the sounds of muffled footsteps scuffling outside of the alley. His emerald eyes calmly opened in observation. He saw the same boy from yesterday, this time barefoot, floundering about. The boy was peaking into and stepping away from the alley in repeated cycles. Ratri glanced at the edge of the dumpster to confirm that there was no bread lying there. There wasn't; after all, he had eaten it. Then for what reason had the boy come again after last night's scare? 
At the entrance of the alleyway, the boy seemed to have reached a decision. Much to Ratri's surprise, the boy ignored Ratri's hisses. The boy's eyes seemed to burn with an unknown determination as he took slow and steady steps toward Ratri. 
Ah. Ratri almost wanted to applaud the boy's courage as he drew a conjecture about the boy's motives: perhaps he was considering a rat of his size, even if injured, as a meal. Stupidly admirable, he thought. 
Ratri leisurely watched the boy close the distance between them as he waited for an opportunity to catch the boy off guard. Although he was forbidden from taking violent action against humans, using the boy's body as a shock-inducing springboard should pose no problem. 
Finally, the boy stopped a few feet away from Ratri and crouched down. He cautiously reached out into the pocket of his loose black shorts. With the morning sunlight shining from above the alleyway, Ratri's vision of the boy was much clearer than it was in the night. Dark bruises adorned the boy's cheeks, arms, and legs, but it was difficult to tell because the boy's skin tone matched the alley's brown mottled walls. The boy's dark gray hair was matted and oily. The bony protrusions of his shoulder jutted out as he rummaged through his pockets. 
Was the boy taking out his knife?  No matter, even a breeze of wind could knock over the boy anyway. He would certainly have no trouble defending himself.
However, contrary to his expectations, the boy took out a small roll of stained medical bandages from his pocket.
"Hi…Let me…fix you up?" The boy croaked out in a high-pitched, hoarse voice as he waved the bandages in his hand. His azure eyes blinked nervously at him.
"..." Ratri wanted to take his words back. Considering a rat a meal was no admirable feat compared to wanting to befriend it. 
Ratri deliberated his options for a moment before taking action. He slowly walked toward the boy, causing a hopeful light to emerge from the boy's eyes. He then suddenly snatched the bandages from the boy's hands with his teeth, jumped on the boy's shoulder, and landed on the ground behind the boy. The force of impact from the fifteen-pound rat caused the boy to lose his balance. The boy fell back against the concrete pavement. 
"Urgh!" The boy yelped as his back collided harshly with the rough ground. Ratri, already in the midst of running away, didn't even spare a glance at the sound. He had already hidden in the darkness of a nearby drain facing the alleyway by the time the boy had gotten up in a daze, his head turning left and right in search of Ratri.
Ratri witnessed the boy's efforts with an apathetic face. He waited for another two hours in the drain, meanwhile using his teeth to wrap the bandages around the injured parts of his body. After returning back to the alleyway at night, Ratri laid down behind the dumpster placed against the brown walls and closed his eyes. He only thought one thing before falling asleep: peace and quiet had finally arrived.
Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle. Ratri opened his eyes. The boy was back again. He peeked his head out from the side of the dumpster with dead eyes, watching the boy tip-toe into the alleyway with a wide grin.
"Hi!" The boy whispered before crouching down. He opened the palm of his hand to reveal two small strawberry candies and placed one on the ground a few feet in front of Ratri.
"Since you accepted my token of friendship yesterday, I brought us a meal to celebrate." 
"..." Ratri was baffled. What kind of loose brain circuits did this kid have? How did stealing bandages become a token of friendship?  
But… Ratri stared silently at the candy on the ground and felt his stomach pang. After eating rotten food for the past few days, the pink and smooth surface of the candy looked especially appealing. Ratri wasn't the type to deny food brought to his feet. He walked to the candy and licked it up, letting its flavor soak into his mouth. Delicious. Perhaps providing companionship to this boy in exchange for free food wasn't such a horrible idea. 
Watching Ratri eat the candy, the boy's grin stretched into a full-blown smile, his eyes bent into crescents of glee. The boy also took the candy and popped it into his mouth.
"My name is Dina. Ratty will be yours." The boy mumbled to himself before getting up. Ratri turned a deaf ear to the boy's, Dina's, decision.
"I'll be back, Ratty!" Dina chortled before escaping in a hurry, almost tripping over his black flip-flops in his bout of laughter. Ratri wrinkled his snout in disgust, but his eyes failed to reveal the same emotion.
Shuffle. Shuffle. Shuffle. Ratri awoke to this sound often now. Dina would come every evening with  something new in his hands to give: stolen naan; pizza box leftovers; new flavored candies. At first, Ratri would only eat the food and then heartlessly retreat back to his spot at the dumpster. 
But the boy wasn't discouraged at all. 
"You know, I don't actually like rats. Even I feel like a lunatic when I talk to you. But most rats here don't get hurt unless they've been abandoned by their pack. Guess we're two peas in a pod." One day, the boy told him this in a string of raspy laughs. His right eye, the left one had come that evening swollen to the point of disfigurement, bent into a crescent as if smiling as well.
"Since we only have each other, we'll be friends who'll always stick together." Dina reached out to pet Ratri in melancholy, only to get his hand mercilessly slapped away by Ratri's paw.
"Ow."
Friends. Ratri paid no attention to Dina as he pondered those words in consternation. There was no way Dina believed they were friends. He, an esteemed general from the galaxy's Empire, the same as a weak street urchin from the slums? He had only one friend, the Empress, in his hundred years of living, and that friendship was accompanied by banishments and royal orders.
Yet despite all that, tiny bubbles seemed to be floating around in his body, making him feel as light as a feather. Ratri glanced warily at the boy.
He wasn't aware the boy could use witchcraft. Should he abandon this alleyway and find a new shelter? It was too dangerous to stay with this boy in his current state. Ratri's eyes began to wander toward the alleyway's exit.
"Ratri? What are you looking at?" Dina turned around to look behind him, where only the gray sky and rubble lay in front of the alleyway. His stretched neck and turned cheek revealed more bruises coloring Dina's skin with purple and blue hues.
Ratri's determination collapsed into a puddle. Forget it, why quibble with a weak street urchin.
